Well there's no doubt that your presentation went well. Great job on prepping for that, you guys nailed it.

I do have some concerns about the app itself, unfortunately. I am not surprised that you had difficulty with the APIs, but I was surprised at where you ended up.

Loading individual music tracks would have been fine, however, using the file name to parse out the artist and song title was a bit...unorthodox? A database would have
made a lot more sense here and looked a lot more professional.

I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't hear of your issues directly. I wasn't sure what to expect of the music playing portion of the app until your demonstration. It would have
been nice to have gotten more concrete feedback about that ahead of time. Maybe we could have helped you come up with a better solution.

The UI was nice and clearly you spent a large chunk of time on that which was appreciated.
