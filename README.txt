//NOTE:

To-Do list for our final project/wish list.

1. Multiplayer still needs to be implemented. Basic implemention has been discussed, but actually server to device communication proved to be a challenge
to us during these few weeks and required too many resources/time that we just could not have devoted to.

2. Implement more options to play: i.e guess that producer, guess by album, guess by genre. Really an endless amount of possibilities to go with here,
and we will continue to develop this application with the hope to one day to develop 

3. UI could have been a little more clean in terms of spicing up some plain text or animations. Also could have cleaned up some aspects of switching
between activities as well.

Overall, we were super happy about the product that we ended up with and am glad that we were given the opportunity to work on this 
amazing project and an amazing course! Thank you guys so much!
